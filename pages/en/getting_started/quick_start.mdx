This section will guide you through a minimal runnable example **sayhello** to help you quickly understand how to implement a minimal system based on UR-2.0, including:

- The basic structure of the Pipeline configuration file
- How to modify parameters
- How to run the complete process

<Tip>If you have not installed UR-2.0 yet, please refer to [Environment Setup](/pages/cn/getting_started/installation) first.</Tip>

<Tip>For more advanced RAG practices, please visit [Development Guide](/pages/cn/tutorials/part_1/server_index).</Tip>

## Step 1: Understand the Pipeline Configuration Structure

<Info>Make sure the development root directory is under the UltraRAG folder</Info>

Below is a minimal example configuration file:

```yaml examples/sayhello.yaml icon="/images/yaml.svg"
servers:
  sayhello: servers/sayhello

pipeline:
  - sayhello.greet
```

This configuration file contains two core parts:

- `servers`: Declares all components (Servers) used in the current process. Here, the example `sayhello` Server is used.
- `pipeline`: Defines the calling order of the functional functions (Tools) in the Server. In this example, the `greet` tool function of the `sayhello` Server is called, which outputs a welcome message.

## Step 2: Automatically Generate Parameter Configuration File

Before running the code, the primary step is to configure the parameters required for execution. UR-2.0 provides a convenient Build command to automate this process: the system reads the parameter.yaml of each Server, parses all parameter items involved in this process, and aggregates them into a unified configuration file. Run the following command:

```shell
ultrarag build examples/sayhello.yaml
```

Terminal output:

![](/images/getting_started/sayhello_build.png)

You will get an automatically generated parameter configuration file with a basic format as follows:

```yaml examples/parameters/sayhello_parameter.yaml icon="/images/yaml.svg"
sayhello:
  name: UltraRAG 2.0  # You can modify this to the name you want to pass in
```

Fill in the parameters you want to pass to the `greet` tool here (such as the name in the welcome message).

## Step 3: Run the Pipeline

Once everything is ready, run the following command to execute the complete process:

```shell
ultrarag run examples/sayhello.yaml
```

You will see similar output in the terminal and log files:
