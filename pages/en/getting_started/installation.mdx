UR-2.0 provides a user-friendly installation method, allowing users to complete the basic environment setup with just a few commands. At the same time, UR-2.0 supports a modular dependency system with on-demand loading, facilitating flexible expansion of required functional components and avoiding redundant installations.

## Step 1: Preparation before installation

Create a virtual environment using Conda:

```shell
conda create -n ultrarag python=3.11
conda activate ultrarag
```

<Tip>Don't have Conda installed? Go to [Install Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install).</Tip>

We recommend using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for package management, which provides a faster and more reliable Python dependency management experience:

```shell
pip install uv
```

## Step 2: Install the basic environment

<Note>We will gradually support PyPI and Conda distributions</Note>

Clone the project to your local machine or server via git:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/OpenBMB/UltraRAG.git
cd UltraRAG
```

Create a virtual environment with Conda and install basic dependencies:

```shell
uv pip install -e .
```

## Step 3: Verify the installation

Run the following command to test if the installation was successful:

```shell
ultrarag run examples/sayhello.yaml
```

If the environment is correct, the terminal will output a welcome message:

![](/images/getting_started/sayhello_run.png)

## Step 4: Install optional extension components as needed

UR-2.0 supports rich Server components, allowing developers to flexibly install required dependencies according to actual tasks:

```shell
# If you want to use faiss for vector indexing:
# You need to manually compile and install different versions of FAISS according to your hardware environment
# Install faiss-cpu
conda install -c pytorch faiss-cpu
# Install faiss-gpu
conda install -c pytorch faiss-gpu

# If you want to use infinity_emb for corpus encoding and indexing:
uv pip install -e ."[infinity_emb]"

# If you want to use lancedb vector database:
uv pip install -e ."[lancedb]"

# If you want to deploy models with vLLM service:
uv pip install -e ."[vllm]"

# If you want to use corpus document parsing features:
uv pip install -e ."[corpus]"

# Install all dependencies (except faiss)
uv pip install -e ."[all]"
```
