## Install UltraRAG 2.0

It is recommended to use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to install and manage UltraRAG 2.0, providing a faster and more reliable Python dependency management experience.

```shell
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/ultrarag/UltraRAG-MCP.git
cd UltraRAG-MCP

# Create a conda environment
conda create -n ultramcp python=3.11
conda activate ultramcp

# Install fastmcp
pip install uv
uv pip install fastmcp==2.10

# Install base dependencies (excluding torch, faiss, vllm and other optional components)
uv pip install -e .
```

UltraRAG 2.0 supports a variety of third-party extensions, which can be installed as needed:

```shell
# ====== faiss dependency notes ======
# faiss-gpu needs to be compiled manually, and pre-built wheels cannot be reused
# Please install the CPU or GPU version of FAISS based on your hardware environment:
conda install -c pytorch faiss-cpu
conda install -c pytorch faiss-gpu

# To use infinity_emb for corpus encoding and indexing:
uv pip install -e ."[infinity_emb]"

# To use lancedb as a vector database:
uv pip install -e ."[lancedb]"

# To deploy models with vLLM service:
uv pip install -e ."[vllm]"

# To enable corpus document parsing:
uv pip install -e ."[corpus]"

# ====== Install all dependencies (except faiss) ======
uv pip install -e ."[all]"
```
