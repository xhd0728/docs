## Function

Benchmark Server is used to load benchmark datasets, commonly used in the data configuration phase of benchmark testing, question answering tasks, or generation tasks.

<Info>We strongly recommend preprocessing the data into `.jsonl` format.</Info>

Sample data:

```json data/sample_asqa_5.jsonl icon="/images/json.svg"
{"idx": 0, "question": "Where does it rain the most in texas?", "golden_answers": ["Piney Woods", "eastern region of Texas", "the far east"]}
{"idx": 1, "question": "Who won the us open golf in 2017?", "golden_answers": ["Brooks Koepka", "United States", "Park Sung-hyun", "South Korea"]}
{"idx": 2, "question": "Where does the term cupboard love come from?", "golden_answers": ["Sigmund Freud, Anna Freud, Melanie Klein and Mary Ainsworth", "1950s and 1960s", "psychoanalysis"]}
{"idx": 3, "question": "Who took control of the italian government in 1922?", "golden_answers": ["National Fascist Party", "Benito Mussolini", "Italian fascists", "National Fascist Party", "PNF", "Partito Nazionale Fascista", "Benito Mussolini", "Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini"]}
{"idx": 4, "question": "What's the percentage of canadian hockey players in the nhl?", "golden_answers": ["75", "slightly less than 50"]}
```

## Parameter Description

Below is the configuration file `servers/benchmark/parameter.yaml`:

```yaml servers/benchmark/parameter.yaml icon="/images/yaml.svg"
benchmark:
  name: asqa
  path: data/sample_asqa_5.jsonl
  key_map:
    q_ls: question
    gt_ls: golden_answers
  shuffle: false
  seed: 42
  limit: 2
```

- `name`: Dataset name, used for logging, debugging, or identifying the currently loaded dataset in the system.
- `path`: Data file path, serves as the entry point for the `get_data` utility.
- `key_map`: Field mapping table, specifies which fields to extract from each sample and sets their aliases.
  - For example: `q_ls: question` means mapping the original field `question` to `q_ls`.
  - To add extra fields, extend here, such as `p_ls: retrieved_passage`.
- `shuffle`: Whether to enable random sampling.
- `seed`: Set random seed.
- `limit`: Number of samples to load; `-1` means loading all data.

## Tool Functions

- `get_data`: This utility function is used to load and parse data during the preprocessing phase, extracting key fields (such as questions, answers, retrieved passages, etc.) for downstream modules.
