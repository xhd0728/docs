## `Server` Function

The `Benchmark Server` is used to load datasets for evaluation, commonly used for benchmarking, question answering tasks, or as the data input stage in generation tasks.

We highly recommend preprocessing your data into `.jsonl` format.

### Parameter Description

Below is the configuration file for `servers/benchmark/parameter.yaml`:

```yaml
# servers/benchmark/parameter.yaml
benchmark:
  name: asqa
  path: data/sample_asqa_5.jsonl
  key_map:
    q_ls: question
    gt_ls: golden_answers
  limit: 2
```

- `name`: The name of the dataset, used for logging, debugging, or identifying the currently loaded dataset in the system.
- `path`: Path to the data file, serving as the input for the `get_data` tool.
- `key_map`: Field mapping table, specifying which fields to extract from each sample and their aliases.
  - For example: `q_ls: question` maps the original field `question` to `q_ls`.
  - To add additional fields, simply extend this section, e.g., `p_ls: retrieved_passage`.
- `limit`: Number of samples to load; `-1` means loading all data.

## Tool Function Description

- `get_data`: This tool function is used to load and parse data during the preprocessing stage, extracting key fields (such as questions, answers, retrieved passages, etc.) for downstream modules to use.
