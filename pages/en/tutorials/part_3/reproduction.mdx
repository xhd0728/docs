UltraRAG has integrated multiple classic and cutting-edge RAG baseline methods and provides unified interfaces for running and evaluation, making it easy for users to quickly reproduce and compare. The currently supported baselines include:

- Vanilla LLM
- Vanilla RAG
- CRAG
- DeepNote
- IRCoT
- IterRetGen
- R1-Searcher
- RankCoT
- Search-o1
- Search-r1

More baselines are continuously being added. Related experimental results and reproduction settings are continuously maintained and updated on the Leaderboard page.

## Quick Reproduction

Users can quickly reproduce any baseline method in two steps:

### 1. Build the Pipeline Configuration

```shell
ultrarag build examples/<baseline_name>.yaml
```

### 2. Run the Pipeline for Inference and Evaluation

```shell
ultrarag run examples/<baseline_name>.yaml
```

Replace `<baseline_name>` with the YAML filename of the corresponding baseline method (e.g., vanilla_rag.yaml, ircot.yaml, etc.).

ðŸ“Œ Tip: To see all available YAML files for baselines, please refer to the examples/ directory in the project.
