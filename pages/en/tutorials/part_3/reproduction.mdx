UltraRAG integrates multiple classic and cutting-edge RAG baseline methods, providing a unified interface for running and evaluation, enabling users to quickly reproduce and compare results. Currently supported baselines include:

- Vanilla LLM
- Vanilla RAG
- IRCoT
- IterRetGen
- Search-o1

More baselines are continuously being updated. Related experimental results and reproduction settings will be continuously maintained and updated on the [Leaderboard](https://pbem31gvoj.feishu.cn/sheets/TfbisiADfhOpnnt9wBhcE5gsn4o?from=from_copylink&sheet=4d3449) page.

## Quick Reproduction Method

Users can quickly reproduce any baseline method in two steps:

### 1. Build Pipeline Configuration

```shell
ultrarag build examples/<baseline_name>.yaml
```

### 2. Run Pipeline for Inference and Evaluation

```shell
ultrarag run examples/<baseline_name>.yaml
```

Please replace `<baseline_name>` with the YAML file name corresponding to the baseline method (e.g., `vanilla_rag.yaml`, `ircot.yaml`, etc.).

<Note>Tip: To view all available baseline YAML files, please refer to the examples/ directory in the project.</Note>
