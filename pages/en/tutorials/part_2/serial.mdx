The serial structure is the most basic and common execution mode in the UltraRAG Pipeline. Multiple steps are executed in order, and the output of the previous step (if any) can be used as the input for the next step, or steps can be executed independently. Building a basic RAG workflow is usually possible with just the serial structure.

## Example: Vanilla RAG Pipeline

```yaml
# Vanilla RAG demo

# MCP Server
servers:
  benchmark: servers/benchmark
  prompt: servers/prompt
  generation: servers/generation
  evaluation: servers/evaluation
  custom: servers/custom

# MCP Client Pipeline
pipeline:
- benchmark.get_data
- prompt.qa_boxed
- generation.generate
- custom.output_extract_from_boxed
- evaluation.evaluate
```

## Explanation

In the serial structure, each line represents a call to a registered Tool, and the basic syntax is:

- server_name.tool_name
- server_name: the name of the module to be called, which must be defined in the servers section;
- tool_name: the function registered in the module via the @tool(...) or @prompt(...) decorator.

This structure is suitable for most single-turn QA or reasoning tasks, and is also the foundation for understanding more complex workflows such as loops and branches.
