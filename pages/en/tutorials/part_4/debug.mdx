To develop and debug UltraRAG more efficiently, you can use VSCode's debugging features to run a specific Pipeline configuration and perform breakpoint debugging.

## Step 1: Create the Debug Configuration File

Create a `.vscode/launch.json` file in the project root directory and add the following content:

```json
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "UltraRAG-MCP Debug",
            "type": "debugpy",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/src/ultrarag_mcp/client.py",
            "console": "integratedTerminal",
            "args": [
                "run",
                "${workspaceFolder}/examples/xxx.yaml" # Replace with the path to your Pipeline configuration file
            ],
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
        }
    ]
}
```

## Step 2: Start Debugging

1. Open the Debug panel on the left side of VSCode (shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+D).
2. Select "UltraRAG-MCP Debug" from the debug configurations.
3. Click the green â–¶ start button to run and debug UltraRAG directly in VSCode's integrated terminal.

You can set breakpoints in any Python file to step through and observe the execution flow and variable states.
