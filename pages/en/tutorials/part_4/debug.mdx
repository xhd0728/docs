To develop and debug UltraRAG more efficiently, you can run a specified Pipeline configuration through VSCode's debugging feature and perform breakpoint debugging.

## Step 1: Create a Debug Configuration File

Create a `.vscode/launch.json` file in the project root directory and write the following content:

```json .vscode/launch.json icon="/images/json.svg"
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "UltraRAG Debug",
            "type": "debugpy",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/src/ultrarag_mcp/client.py",
            "console": "integratedTerminal",
            "args": [
                "run",
                "${workspaceFolder}/examples/xxx.yaml" # Replace with your Pipeline configuration file path
            ],
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
        }
    ]
}
```

## Step 2: Start Debugging

1. Open the debug panel on the left side of VSCode (shortcut Ctrl+Shift+D).
2. Select UltraRAG Debug in the debug configurations.
3. Click the green â–¶ start button to run and debug in the integrated terminal within VSCode.

You can set breakpoints in any Python file to step through the execution flow and observe variable states.
