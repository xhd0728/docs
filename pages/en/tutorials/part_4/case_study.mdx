UltraRAG 2.0 provides a convenient Case Study visualization mechanism to help researchers quickly inspect and analyze whether the pipeline they built meets the expected requirements.

After running the pipeline.yaml file, the system will automatically generate a memory log file in the output folder, for example: `output/memory_nq_rag_20250818_122640.json`. Simply execute the following command to start the Case Study visualization website:

```shell
python ./script/case_study.py \
  --data output/memory_nq_rag_20250818_122640.json \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 8080 \
  --title "Case Study Viewer"
```

After successful startup, you can access the corresponding address through a browser to enter the Case Study Viewer interface. This interface will visually display the inputs and outputs of each stage of the pipeline along with memory tracking information, making it easy to step-by-step check the reasoning chain and intermediate states. The interface example is shown in the following figure:

Researchers can switch between different cases one by one, intuitively comparing the relationships among input questions, retrieval results, and model outputs, thereby more efficiently diagnosing potential issues, optimizing pipeline design, and verifying whether the entire reasoning process meets expectations.
